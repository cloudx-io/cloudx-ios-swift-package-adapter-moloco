```text
https://github.com/cloudx-io/cloudx-ios-swift-package-adapter-moloco.git
```

Select an exact package version from the compatibility table. Add the
`CloudXMolocoAdapter` product to the app target.

Add `-ObjC` to the app target's **Other Linker Flags**. The package uses this
flag to retain the adapter registration code.

The package installs CloudX Core and Moloco SDK as dependencies. Import
`CloudXCore` in the application. The adapter registers when the application
loads.

The package tag joins the adapter components into the major number. For example,
adapter `4.11.1.1` uses package version `4110101.0.0`.
